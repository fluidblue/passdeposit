# Regular expression for email addresses.
# It is kept very simple. This will hopefully provide support for
# email addresses using new features like new TLD domains etc.
# Matches are like: nowhitespaces@nowhitespaces.nowhitespaces
reEmail = /^\S+@\S+\.\S+$/

# Regular expression for safe passwords.
#
# A safe password must fulfill:
#   * at least one uppercase letter
#   * at least one lowercase letter
#   * at least one digit
#   * 8 characters or longer
#
# This is a modified version of
