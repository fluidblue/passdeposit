## Features

* Your data is encrypted and decrypted directly in your browser using AES-256
* The server is not able to decrypt your data
* Connections to PassDeposit are secured by SSL/TLS (HTTPS)
* PassDeposit is open source, you can review the source code before trusting it
* Import and export (backup) your data
* You can [host your own installation](INSTALL.md#passdeposit-installation) of PassDeposit to gain maximum control over your data


## Why is it secure?

1. The connection between your browser and the server is secured by SSL/TLS (HTTPS). Thus no one can eavesdrop on the data being exchanged.

2. **The server is not able to decrypt your data**, because your password is never sent to the server.

3. 2-step authentication:

	Your password is hashed in the browser with [PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) (1000 iterations) using SHA-256. The resulting hash acts as your authentication key and is sent to the server.

	The server hashes your authentication key with PBKDF2 (300000 iterations) using SHA-1 and a random salt. The random salt is re-generated every time you change your password.

4. After authentication, the connection is secured by using sessions (256 bit random hashes).

5. The database is regularly backed up on two servers. Those servers are not located at the same computing center.
